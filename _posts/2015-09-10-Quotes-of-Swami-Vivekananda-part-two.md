26. Neither numbers nor powers nor wealth nor learning nor eloquence nor anything else will prevail, but purity, living the life, in one word , realization.

27. Never mind the struggles, the mistakes. I never heard a cow tell a lie, but it is only a cow— never a man. So never mind these failures, these little back sliding; hold the ideal a thousand times, and if you fail a thousand times, make the attempt once more.

28. Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only sin ? to say that you are weak, or others are weak.

30. No need for looking behind. FORWARD! We want infinite energy, infinite zeal, infinite courage, and infinite patience, then only will great things achieved.

31. Oh, if only you knew yourselves! You are souls; you are Gods. If ever I feel like blaspheming, it is when I call you man.

32. Pay no attention whatsoever to newspaper nonsense or criticism. Be sincere and do your duty. Everything will come all right. Truth must triumph.

33. Perfect sincerity, holiness, gigantic intellect, and all-conquering will. Let only a handful of men work with these, and the whole world will be revolutionized.

34. Persevere on, my brave lads, We have only just begun. Never despond! Never say enough!

35. Purity, perseverance, and energy— these three I want.

36. Purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles. All great things must of necessity be slow.

37. Say, "I can do everything." "Even if poison of a snake is powerless if you can firmly deny it."

38. Say, "This misery that I am suffering is of my own doing, and that very thing proves that it will have to be undone by me alone."

39. Take courage and work on. Patience and steady work— this is the only way.

40. Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is way great spiritual giants are produced.

41. "The earth is enjoyed by heroes"— this is the unfailing truth. Be a hero. Always say, "I have no fear".

42. The remedy for weakness is not brooding over weakness, but thinking of strength.

43. This is the great fact: strength is life, weakness is death. Strength is felicity, life eternal, immortal; weakness is constant strain and misery: weakness is death.

44. To succeed, you must have tremendous perseverance, tremendous will. 'I will drink the ocean', says the persevering soul, 'at my will mountains will crumble up.' Have that sort of energy, that sort of will, work hard, and you will reach the goal.

45. To work with undaunted energy! What fear! Who is powerful enough to thwart you.

46. Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.

47. We are responsible for what we are, and whatever we wish ourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves. If what we are now has been the result of our own past actions, it certainly follows that whatever we wish to be in future can be produced by our present actions; so we have to know how to act.

48. We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.

49. We reap what we sow. We are the makers of our own fate. None else has the blame, none has the praise.

50. Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak, weak you will be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be.1. All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.
