1. ***Stay active; don't retire.*** Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. Thats why it's so important **to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you**, even after your official professional activity has ended.

2. ***Take it slow.*** Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, **"Walk slowly and you'll go far."** When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.

3. ***Don't fill your stomach.*** Less in more when it comes to eating for long life, too. According to **the 80 percent rule**, in order to stay healthier longer, we should **eat a little less than our hunger demands** instead of stuffing ourselves.

4. ***Surround yourself with good friends.*** Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries **over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming**... in other words, living.

5. ***Get in shape for your next birthday.*** Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn't stagnate. The body you move through life **in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running** for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy.

6. ***Smile.*** A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing - it also helps make friends. It's good to recognize the things that aren't so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now **in a world so full of possibilities**.

7. ***Reconnect with nature.*** Though most people live in cities these days, **human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often** to recharge our batteries.

8. ***Give Thanks.*** To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to **everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive.** Spend a moment everyday giving thanks, and you'll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.

9. ***Live in the moment.*** Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. **Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering**.

10. ***Follow your ikigai.*** There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you don't know what your ikigai it yet, as Viktor Frankl say, **your mission is to discover it**.

Last,

> ***Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.***
