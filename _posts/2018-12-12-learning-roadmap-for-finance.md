> If you want to involve in  the field which is unfamiliar to you, first thing to do is to *know and understand* the field.

That is what I believe that I should do first if I want to be in the finance field. Up until now, I just have very basic understanding of the word **finance**. I have decided to give myself **three months** to learn  about finance in detail. Not to forget, finance alone is not sufficient for me if I am planning to become a quant. So I have decided to learn **computational finance** with **python** programming language as well as some math such as **calculus and statistic**.
