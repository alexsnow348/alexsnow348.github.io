> If you want to involve in  the field which is unfamiliar to you, first thing to do is to *know and understand* the field.

That is what I believe that I should do first if I want to be in the finance field. Up until now, I just have very basic understanding of the word **finance**. I have decided to give myself **three months** to learn  about finance in detail. Not to forget, finance alone is not sufficient for me if I am planning to become a quant. So I have decided to learn **computational finance** with **python** programming language as well as required Maths.

#### Courses
* [Economics of Money and Banking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking)
* [Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-reinforcement-finance)

#### Books
* The Global Financial System 1750â€“2000.
* The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism
* The Alchemists of Loss How Modern Finance & Government Intervention Crashed the Financial System

I need to utilize my new acquired knowledge, therefore, I decided to participate and learn from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) community as well.
