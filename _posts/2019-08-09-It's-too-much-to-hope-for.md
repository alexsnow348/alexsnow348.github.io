It is too much to hope for a life without pain,<br />
It is wrong to expect a life without pain,<br />
for pain is our body's defense.<br />

No matter how much we dislike it,<br />
And nobody likes pain,<br />
Pain is important,<br />
And,<br />
for pain, we should be grateful!<br />

<!-- more -->
How else would we know,<br />
To move our hand from the fire?<br />
Our finger from the blade?<br />
Our foot from the thorn?<br />
So pain is important,<br />
And for pain, we should be grateful!<br />

Yet,<br />
There is a type of pain that serves<br />
no purpose,<br />
That's chronic pain,<br />
It's that elite band of pain<br />
that's not for defense.<br />
It is an attacking force.<br />
A destroyer of personal happiness<br />
An aggressive assailant on personal ability,<br />
A ceaseless invader of personal peace<br />
And,<br />
A continuous harassment to life!<br />

Chronic pain is the hardest hurdle<br />
for the mind to jump.<br />
Sometimes it is almost impossible to jump,<br />
Yet, we must keep trying,<br />
And trying,<br />
And trying,<br />
Because if we don't, it will destroy.<br />

And,<br />
from this battle will come some good,<br />
The satisfaction of overcoming pain,<br />
The achievement of happiness and<br />
peace of life in spite of it.<br />
This is quite an achievement,<br />
An achievement very special,<br />
very personal,<br />
A feeling of strength of inner strength<br />
Which has to be experienced to be understood.<br />

So, we all have to accept pain,<br />
Even sometimes destructive pain.<br />
For it is part of the scheme of things,<br />
And the mind can manage it,<br />
And the mind will become stronger for the practice.<br />
