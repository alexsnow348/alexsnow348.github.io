	The project aims to forecast next day exchange rate value based on previous exchange rates data sets and built using <strong>R, and R Shiny.</strong> Models are constructed with Artificial Neural Networks techniques (ANN) such as <strong>MLP, RNN, RBF.</strong> Code implementation is available for both <strong> <a href="https://github.com/wuthmone/FYP-Exchange-Rate-Forecasting-Using-Ensemble-ANN-Model" target="_blank">Models</a> </strong>  and  <strong><a href="https://github.com/wuthmone/FYP-Interactive-Web-App" target="_blank">Web App </a></strong> on GitHub.

* <strong><a href ="https://github.com/alexsnow348/investment-for-all" target="_blank">Investment for all (immigrants and illegal workers)</a></strong>

	The project aims to solve the problem where minority: immigrants and illegal workers do not have enough privileged to participate in the market. Can we make a room for them where they can invest and grow their savings for themselves? This project plans to tickle about questions and hopefully will come out with a solution for their problem.
