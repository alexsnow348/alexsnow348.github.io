## 2018

* <strong><a href ="https://github.com/alexsnow348/investment-for-all" target="_blank">Investment for all (immigrants and illegal workers)</a></strong>

	The project aims to solve the problem where minority: immigrants and illegal workers do not have enough privileged to participate in the market. Can we make a room for them where they can invest and grow their savings for themselves? This project plans to tickle above question and hopefully will come out with a solution for their problem.
